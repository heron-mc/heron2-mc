# Heron/resources

This folder contains static resources (typically an "images" folder as well).

The file HeronInit.js initializes all Heron configs and settings. Because this file is placed here, it will
not be minimized and can be modified after the source code has been build.    

The files in the "i18n" directory are copied from the original Heron 1 version. Modifications
are made to resolve some errors.
